name: VMXConfig
required: []
not_required:
- name: vmx_data
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    Arbitrary key/values to enter
    into the virtual machine VMX file. This is for advanced users who want to
    set properties that aren't yet supported by the builder.
- name: vmx_data_post
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    Identical to vmx_data,
    except that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the
    virtual machine is exported.
- name: vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Remove all ethernet interfaces
    from the VMX file after building. This is for advanced users who understand
    the ramifications, but is useful for building Vagrant boxes since Vagrant
    will create ethernet interfaces when provisioning a box. Defaults to
    false.
- name: display_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name that will appear in your vSphere client,
    and will be used for the vmx basename. This will override the "displayname"
    value in your vmx file. It will also override the "displayname" if you have
    set it in the "vmx_data" Packer option. This option is useful if you are
    chaining vmx builds and want to make sure that the display name of each step
    in the chain is unique.
