name: Config
required: []
not_required:
- name: memory
  type: uint
  docs: |
    The amount, in megabytes, of RAM to assign to the
    VM. By default, this is 1 GB.
- name: secondary_iso_images
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of ISO paths to
    attach to a VM when it is booted. This is most useful for unattended
    Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on removable
    media. By default, no secondary ISO will be attached.
- name: guest_additions_mode
  type: string
  docs: |
    If set to attach then attach and
    mount the ISO image specified in guest_additions_path. If set to
    none then guest additions are not attached and mounted; This is the
    default.
- name: guest_additions_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path to the ISO image for guest
    additions.
- name: clone_from_vmcx_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the path to a directory containing an exported virtual machine.
- name: clone_from_vm_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the name of the virtual machine to clone from.
- name: clone_from_snapshot_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name of a snapshot in the
    source machine to use as a starting point for the clone. If the value
    given is an empty string, the last snapshot present in the source will
    be chosen as the starting point for the new VM.
- name: clone_all_snapshots
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If set to true all snapshots
    present in the source machine will be copied when the machine is
    cloned. The final result of the build will be an exported virtual
    machine that contains all the snapshots of the parent.
- name: vm_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the name of the new virtual machine,
    without the file extension. By default this is "packer-BUILDNAME",
    where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
- name: differencing_disk
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true enables differencing disks. Only
    the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
    your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.
- name: switch_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name of the switch to connect the virtual
    machine to. By default, leaving this value unset will cause Packer to
    try and determine the switch to use by looking for an external switch
    that is up and running.
- name: copy_in_compare
  type: bool
  docs: |
    When cloning a vm to build from, we run a powershell
    Compare-VM command, which, depending on your version of Windows, may need
    the "Copy" flag to be set to true or false. Defaults to "false". Command:
- name: switch_vlan_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the VLAN of the virtual switch's
    network card. By default none is set. If none is set then a VLAN is not
    set on the switch's network card. If this value is set it should match
    the VLAN specified in by vlan_id.
- name: mac_address
  type: string
  docs: |
    This allows a specific MAC address to be used on
    the default virtual network card. The MAC address must be a string with
    no delimiters, for example "0000deadbeef".
- name: vlan_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the VLAN of the virtual machine's network
    card for the new virtual machine. By default none is set. If none is set
    then VLANs are not set on the virtual machine's network card.
- name: cpus
  type: uint
  docs: |
    The number of CPUs the virtual machine should use. If
    this isn't specified, the default is 1 CPU.
- name: generation
  type: uint
  docs: |
    The Hyper-V generation for the virtual machine. By
    default, this is 1. Generation 2 Hyper-V virtual machines do not support
    floppy drives. In this scenario use secondary_iso_images instead. Hard
    drives and DVD drives will also be SCSI and not IDE.
- name: enable_mac_spoofing
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true enable MAC address spoofing
    for the virtual machine. This defaults to false.
- name: enable_dynamic_memory
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true enable dynamic memory for
    the virtual machine. This defaults to false.
- name: enable_secure_boot
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true enable secure boot for the
    virtual machine. This defaults to false. See secure_boot_template
    below for additional settings.
- name: secure_boot_template
  type: string
  docs: |
    The secure boot template to be
    configured. Valid values are "MicrosoftWindows" (Windows) or
    "MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority" (Linux). This only takes effect if
    enable_secure_boot is set to "true". This defaults to "MicrosoftWindows".
- name: enable_virtualization_extensions
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true enable
    virtualization extensions for the virtual machine. This defaults to
    false. For nested virtualization you need to enable MAC spoofing,
    disable dynamic memory and have at least 4GB of RAM assigned to the
    virtual machine.
- name: temp_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The location under which Packer will create a
    directory to house all the VM files and folders during the build.
    By default %TEMP% is used which, for most systems, will evaluate to
    %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/Temp.
- name: configuration_version
  type: string
  docs: |
    This allows you to set the vm version when
     calling New-VM to generate the vm.
- name: keep_registered
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If "true", Packer will not delete the VM from
    The Hyper-V manager.
- name: communicator
  type: string
  docs: Communicator
- name: skip_compaction
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true skip compacting the hard disk for
    the virtual machine when exporting. This defaults to false.
- name: skip_export
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If true Packer will skip the export of the VM.
    If you are interested only in the VHD/VHDX files, you can enable this
    option. The resulting VHD/VHDX file will be output to
    <output_directory>/Virtual Hard Disks. By default this option is false
    and Packer will export the VM to output_directory.
- name: headless
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Packer defaults to building Hyper-V virtual
    machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being
    built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start without a
    console.
