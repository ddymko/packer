source_path: builder/amazon/chroot/builder.go
name: Config
required:
- name: source_ami
  type: string
  docs: |
    The source AMI whose root volume will be copied and
    provisioned on the currently running instance. This must be an EBS-backed
    AMI with a root volume snapshot that you have access to. Note: this is not
    used when from_scratch is set to true.
not_required:
- name: chroot_mounts
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=1395) <nil> %!s(*ast.ArrayType=&{1397 <nil> 0xc0000f6760})}'
  docs: |
    This is a list of devices to
    mount into the chroot environment. This configuration parameter requires
    some additional documentation which is in the Chroot
    Mounts section. Please read that section for more
    information on how to use this.
- name: command_wrapper
  type: string
  docs: |
    How to run shell commands. This defaults to
    {{.Command}}. This may be useful to set if you want to set environmental
    variables or perhaps run it with sudo or so on. This is a configuration
    template where the .Command variable is replaced with the command to be
    run. Defaults to {{.Command}}.
- name: copy_files
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=2234) <nil> string}'
  docs: |
    Paths to files on the running EC2
    instance that will be copied into the chroot environment prior to
    provisioning. Defaults to /etc/resolv.conf so that DNS lookups work. Pass
    an empty list to skip copying /etc/resolv.conf. You may need to do this
    if you're building an image that uses systemd.
- name: device_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path to the device where the root volume of
    the source AMI will be attached. This defaults to "" (empty string), which
    forces Packer to find an open device automatically.
- name: nvme_device_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    When we call the mount command (by default
    mount -o device dir), the string provided in nvme_mount_path will
    replace device in that command. When this option is not set, device in
    that command will be something like /dev/sdf1, mirroring the attached
    device name. This assumption works for most instances but will fail with c5
    and m5 instances. In order to use the chroot builder with c5 and m5
    instances, you must manually set nvme_device_path and device_path.
- name: from_scratch
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Build a new volume instead of starting from an
    existing AMI root volume snapshot. Default false. If true, source_ami
    is no longer used and the following options become required:
    ami_virtualization_type, pre_mount_commands and root_volume_size. The
    below options are also required in this mode only:
- name: mount_options
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=3973) <nil> string}'
  docs: |
    Options to supply the mount command
    when mounting devices. Each option will be prefixed with -o and supplied
    to the mount command ran by Packer. Because this command is ran in a
    shell, user discretion is advised. See this manual page for the mount
    command for valid file
    system specific options.
- name: mount_partition
  type: string
  docs: |
    The partition number containing the /
    partition. By default this is the first partition of the volume, (for
    example, xvda1) but you can designate the entire block device by setting
    "mount_partition": "0" in your config, which will mount xvda instead.
- name: mount_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path where the volume will be mounted. This is
    where the chroot environment will be. This defaults to
    /mnt/packer-amazon-chroot-volumes/{{.Device}}. This is a configuration
    template where the .Device variable is replaced with the name of the
    device where the volume is attached.
- name: post_mount_commands
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=5071) <nil> string}'
  docs: |
    As pre_mount_commands, but the
    commands are executed after mounting the root device and before the extra
    mount and copy steps. The device and mount path are provided by
    {{.Device}} and {{.MountPath}}.
- name: pre_mount_commands
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=5476) <nil> string}'
  docs: |
    A series of commands to execute
    after attaching the root volume and before mounting the chroot. This is not
    required unless using from_scratch. If so, this should include any
    partitioning and filesystem creation commands. The path to the device is
    provided by {{.Device}}.
- name: root_device_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The root device name. For example, xvda.
- name: root_volume_size
  type: int64
  docs: |
    The size of the root volume in GB for the
    chroot environment and the resulting AMI. Default size is the snapshot size
    of the source_ami unless from_scratch is true, in which case this
    field must be defined.
- name: root_volume_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of EBS volume for the chroot
    environment and resulting AMI. The default value is the type of the
    source_ami, unless from_scratch is true, in which case the default
    value is gp2. You can only specify io1 if building based on top of a
    source_ami which is also io1.
- name: source_ami_filter
  type: '&{awscommon AmiFilterOptions}'
  docs: |
    Filters used to populate the source_ami
    field. Example:
- name: root_volume_tags
  type: '&{awscommon TagMap}'
  docs: |
    Tags to apply to the
    volumes that are launched. This is a template
    engine, see Build template
    data for more information.
- name: ami_architecture
  type: string
  docs: |
    what architecture to use when registering the
    final AMI; valid options are "x86_64" or "arm64". Defaults to "x86_64".
