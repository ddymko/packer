    Add the block device
    mappings to the AMI. The block device mappings allow for keys:
- name: ena_support

    Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not
    SriovNetSupport) on HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add
    ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute to your AWS IAM policy. If false, this will
    disable enhanced networking in the final AMI as opposed to passing the
    setting through unchanged from the source. Note: you must make sure
    enhanced networking is enabled on your instance. See Amazon's
    documentation on enabling enhanced
    networking.
