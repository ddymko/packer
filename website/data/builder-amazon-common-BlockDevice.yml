name: BlockDevice
required: []
not_required:
- name: delete_on_termination
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Indicates whether the EBS volume is
    deleted on instance termination. Default false. NOTE: If this
    value is not explicitly set to true and volumes are not cleaned up by
    an alternative method, additional volumes will accumulate after every
    build.
- name: device_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The device name exposed to the instance (for
    example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Required for every device in the block
    device mapping.
- name: encrypted
  type: '*bool'
  docs: |
    Indicates whether or not to encrypt the volume.
    By default, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what it was in
    the source image. Setting false will result in an unencrypted device,
    and true will result in an encrypted one.
- name: iops
  type: int64
  docs: |
    The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that
    the volume supports. See the documentation on
    IOPs
    for more information
- name: no_device
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Suppresses the specified device included in the
    block device mapping of the AMI.
- name: snapshot_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    The ID of the snapshot.
- name: virtual_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The virtual device name. See the
    documentation on Block Device
    Mapping
    for more information.
- name: volume_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The volume type. gp2 for General Purpose
    (SSD) volumes, io1 for Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes, st1 for
    Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, and standard for
    Magnetic volumes.
- name: volume_size
  type: int64
  docs: |
    The size of the volume, in GiB. Required if
    not specifying a snapshot_id.
- name: kms_key_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for boot
    volume encryption. This only applies to the main region, other regions
    where the AMI will be copied will be encrypted by the default EBS KMS key.
    For valid formats see KmsKeyId in the AWS API docs -
    CopyImage.
    This field is validated by Packer, when using an alias, you will have to
    prefix kms_key_id with alias/.
- name: omit_from_artifact
  type: bool
