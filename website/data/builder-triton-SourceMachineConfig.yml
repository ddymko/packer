source_path: builder/triton/source_machine_config.go
name: SourceMachineConfig
required:
- name: source_machine_package
  type: string
  docs: |
    The Triton package to use while
    building the image. Does not affect (and does not have to be the same) as
    the package which will be used for a VM instance running this image. On the
    Joyent public cloud this could for example be g3-standard-0.5-smartos.
- name: source_machine_image
  type: string
  docs: |
    The UUID of the image to base the new
    image on. Triton supports multiple types of images, called 'brands' in
    Triton / Joyent lingo, for contains and VM's. See the chapter Containers
    and virtual machines in
    the Joyent Triton documentation for detailed information. The following
    brands are currently supported by this builder:joyent andkvm. The
    choice of base image automatically decides the brand. On the Joyent public
    cloud a valid source_machine_image could for example be
    70e3ae72-96b6-11e6-9056-9737fd4d0764 for version 16.3.1 of the 64bit
    SmartOS base image (a 'joyent' brand image). source_machine_image_filter
    can be used to populate this UUID.
not_required:
- name: source_machine_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    Name of the VM used for building the
    image. Does not affect (and does not have to be the same) as the name for a
    VM instance running this image. Maximum 512 characters but should in
    practice be much shorter (think between 5 and 20 characters). For example
    mysql-64-server-image-builder. When omitted defaults to
    packer-builder-[image_name].
- name: source_machine_networks
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    The UUID's of Triton
    networks added to the source machine used for creating the image. For
    example if any of the provisioners which are run need Internet access you
    will need to add the UUID's of the appropriate networks here. If this is
    not specified, instances will be placed into the default Triton public and
    internal networks.
- name: source_machine_metadata
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    Triton metadata
    applied to the VM used to create the image. Metadata can be used to pass
    configuration information to the VM without the need for networking. See
    Using the metadata
    API in the
    Joyent documentation for more information. This can for example be used to
    set the user-script metadata key to have Triton start a user supplied
    script after the VM has booted.
- name: source_machine_tags
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    Tags applied to the
    VM used to create the image.
- name: source_machine_firewall_enabled
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Whether or not the firewall
    of the VM used to create an image of is enabled. The Triton firewall only
    filters inbound traffic to the VM. All outbound traffic is always allowed.
    Currently this builder does not provide an interface to add specific
    firewall rules. Unless you have a global rule defined in Triton which
    allows SSH traffic enabling the firewall will interfere with the SSH
    provisioner. The default is false.
- name: source_machine_image_filter
  type: MachineImageFilter
  docs: |
    Filters used to populate the
    source_machine_image field. Example:
