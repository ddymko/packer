    Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of
    the build process using prl_disk_tool utility (except for the case that
    disk_type is set to plain). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt
    the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable
    compaction using this configuration value.

    This is the name of the PVM directory for the new

- name: reassign_mac
  type: bool
  docs: |
    If this is "false" the MAC address of the first
    NIC will reused when imported else a new MAC address will be generated
    by Parallels. Defaults to "false".
