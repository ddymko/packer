    The flavor of the VMware Tools ISO to
    upload into the VM. Valid values are darwin, linux, and windows. By
    default, this is empty, which means VMware tools won't be uploaded.
- name: tools_upload_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path in the VM to upload the
    VMware tools. This only takes effect if tools_upload_flavor is non-empty.
    This is a configuration
    template that has a single
    valid variable: Flavor, which will be the value of tools_upload_flavor.
    By default the upload path is set to {{.Flavor}}.iso. This setting is not
    used when remote_type is esx5.
