source_path: builder/openstack/run_config.go
name: RunConfig
required:
- name: source_image
  type: string
  docs: |
    The ID or full URL to the base image to use. This
    is the image that will be used to launch a new server and provision it.
    Unless you specify completely custom SSH settings, the source image must
    have cloud-init installed so that the keypair gets assigned properly.
- name: source_image_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name of the base image to use. This is
    an alternative way of providing source_image and only either of them can
    be specified.
- name: source_image_filter
  type: ImageFilter
  docs: |
    The search filters for determining the base
    image to use. This is an alternative way of providing source_image and
    only one of these methods can be used. source_image will override the
    filters.
- name: flavor
  type: string
  docs: |
    The ID, name, or full URL for the desired flavor for
    the server to be created.
not_required:
- name: ""
  type: communicator.Config
  docs: Comm
- name: availability_zone
  type: string
  docs: |
    The availability zone to launch the server
    in. If this isn't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster
    will be used. This may be required for some OpenStack clusters.
- name: rackconnect_wait
  type: bool
  docs: |
    For rackspace, whether or not to wait for
    Rackconnect to assign the machine an IP address before connecting via SSH.
    Defaults to false.
- name: floating_ip_network
  type: string
  docs: |
    The ID or name of an external network that
    can be used for creation of a new floating IP.
- name: floating_ip
  type: string
  docs: |
    A specific floating IP to assign to this instance.
- name: reuse_ips
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Whether or not to attempt to reuse existing
    unassigned floating ips in the project before allocating a new one. Note
    that it is not possible to safely do this concurrently, so if you are
    running multiple openstack builds concurrently, or if other processes are
    assigning and using floating IPs in the same openstack project while packer
    is running, you should not set this to true. Defaults to false.
- name: security_groups
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of security groups by name to
    add to this instance.
- name: networks
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of networks by UUID to attach to
    this instance.
- name: ports
  type: '[]string'
  docs: |
    A list of ports by UUID to attach to this
    instance.
- name: user_data
  type: string
  docs: |
    User data to apply when launching the instance. Note
    that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
    being JSON. It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
    Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
    shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.
- name: user_data_file
  type: string
  docs: |
    Path to a file that will be used for the user
    data when launching the instance.
- name: instance_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    Name that is applied to the server instance
    created by Packer. If this isn't specified, the default is same as
    image_name.
- name: instance_metadata
  type: map[string]string
  docs: |
    Metadata that is
    applied to the server instance created by Packer. Also called server
    properties in some documentation. The strings have a max size of 255 bytes
    each.
- name: force_delete
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Whether to force the OpenStack instance to be
    forcefully deleted. This is useful for environments that have
    reclaim / soft deletion enabled. By default this is false.
- name: config_drive
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Whether or not nova should use ConfigDrive for
    cloud-init metadata.
- name: floating_ip_pool
  type: string
  docs: |
    Deprecated use floating_ip_network
    instead.
- name: use_blockstorage_volume
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Use Block Storage service volume for
    the instance root volume instead of Compute service local volume (default).
- name: volume_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    Name of the Block Storage service volume. If this
    isn't specified, random string will be used.
- name: volume_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    Type of the Block Storage service volume. If this
    isn't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster will be
    used.
- name: volume_size
  type: int
  docs: |
    Size of the Block Storage service volume in GB. If
    this isn't specified, it is set to source image min disk value (if set) or
    calculated from the source image bytes size. Note that in some cases this
    needs to be specified, if use_blockstorage_volume is true.
- name: volume_availability_zone
  type: string
  docs: |
    Availability zone of the Block
    Storage service volume. If omitted, Compute instance availability zone will
    be used. If both of Compute instance and Block Storage volume availability
    zones aren't specified, the default enforced by your OpenStack cluster will
    be used.
- name: openstack_provider
  type: string
  docs: |
    Not really used, but here for BC
- name: use_floating_ip
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Deprecated use floating_ip or
    floating_ip_pool instead.
