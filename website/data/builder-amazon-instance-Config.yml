name: Config
required:
- name: account_id
  type: string
  docs: |
    Your AWS account ID. This is required for bundling
    the AMI. This is not the same as the access key. You can find your
    account ID in the security credentials page of your AWS account.
- name: s3_bucket
  type: string
  docs: |
    The name of the S3 bucket to upload the AMI. This
    bucket will be created if it doesn't exist.
- name: x509_cert_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The local path to a valid X509 certificate for
    your AWS account. This is used for bundling the AMI. This X509 certificate
    must be registered with your account from the security credentials page in
    the AWS console.
- name: x509_key_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The local path to the private key for the X509
    certificate specified by x509_cert_path. This is used for bundling the
    AMI.
not_required:
- name: bundle_destination
  type: string
  docs: |
    The directory on the running instance where
    the bundled AMI will be saved prior to uploading. By default this is
    /tmp. This directory must exist and be writable.
- name: bundle_prefix
  type: string
  docs: |
    The prefix for files created from bundling the
    root volume. By default this is image-{{timestamp}}. The timestamp
    variable should be used to make sure this is unique, otherwise it can
    collide with other created AMIs by Packer in your account.
- name: bundle_upload_command
  type: string
  docs: |
    The command to use to upload the bundled
    volume. See the "custom bundle commands" section below for more
    information.
- name: bundle_vol_command
  type: string
  docs: |
    The command to use to bundle the volume.
    See the "custom bundle commands" section below for more information.
- name: x509_upload_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path on the remote machine where the X509
    certificate will be uploaded. This path must already exist and be writable.
    X509 certificates are uploaded after provisioning is run, so it is
    perfectly okay to create this directory as part of the provisioning
    process. Defaults to /tmp.
