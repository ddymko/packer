source_path: builder/virtualbox/ovf/config.go
name: Config
required:
- name: checksum
  type: string
  docs: |
    The checksum for the source_path file. The
    algorithm to use when computing the checksum can be optionally specified
    with checksum_type. When checksum_type is not set packer will guess the
    checksumming type based on checksum length. checksum can be also be a
    file or an URL, in which case checksum_type must be set to file; the
    go-getter will download it and use the first hash found.
- name: source_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path to an OVF or OVA file that acts as the
    source of this build. This currently must be a local file.
not_required:
- name: checksum_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of the checksum specified in checksum.
    Valid values are none, md5, sha1, sha256, or sha512. Although the
    checksum will not be verified when checksum_type is set to "none", this is
    not recommended since OVA files can be very large and corruption does happen
    from time to time.
- name: guest_additions_mode
  type: string
  docs: |
    The method by which guest additions are
    made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are upload,
    attach, or disable. If the mode is attach the guest additions ISO will
    be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is upload
    the guest additions ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by
    guest_additions_path. The default value is upload. If disable is used,
    guest additions won't be downloaded, either.
- name: guest_additions_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path on the guest virtual machine
    where the VirtualBox guest additions ISO will be uploaded. By default this
    is VBoxGuestAdditions.iso which should upload into the login directory of
    the user. This is a configuration
    template where the Version
    variable is replaced with the VirtualBox version.
- name: guest_additions_interface
  type: string
  docs: |
    The interface type to use to mount
    guest additions when guest_additions_mode is set to attach. Will
    default to the value set in iso_interface, if iso_interface is set.
    Will default to "ide", if iso_interface is not set. Options are "ide" and
    "sata".
- name: guest_additions_sha256
  type: string
  docs: |
    The SHA256 checksum of the guest
    additions ISO that will be uploaded to the guest VM. By default the
    checksums will be downloaded from the VirtualBox website, so this only needs
    to be set if you want to be explicit about the checksum.
- name: guest_additions_url
  type: string
  docs: |
    The URL to the guest additions ISO
    to upload. This can also be a file URL if the ISO is at a local path. By
    default, the VirtualBox builder will attempt to find the guest additions ISO
    on the local file system. If it is not available locally, the builder will
    download the proper guest additions ISO from the internet.
- name: import_flags
  type: '&{%!s(token.Pos=4527) <nil> string}'
  docs: |
    Additional flags to pass to
    VBoxManage import. This can be used to add additional command-line flags
    such as --eula-accept to accept a EULA in the OVF.
- name: import_opts
  type: string
  docs: |
    Additional options to pass to the
    VBoxManage import. This can be useful for passing keepallmacs or
    keepnatmacs options for existing ovf images.
- name: target_path
  type: string
  docs: |
    The path where the OVA should be saved
    after download. By default, it will go in the packer cache, with a hash of
    the original filename as its name.
- name: vm_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the name of the OVF file for the new virtual
    machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
    where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
- name: keep_registered
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Set this to true if you would like to keep
    the VM registered with virtualbox. Defaults to false.
- name: skip_export
  type: bool
  docs: |
    Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will
    not export the VM. Useful if the build output is not the resultant image,
    but created inside the VM.
