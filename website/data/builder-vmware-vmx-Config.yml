    By default Packer creates a 'full' clone of
    the virtual machine specified in source_path. The resultant virtual
    machine is fully independant from the parent it was cloned from.
- name: remote_type
  type: string
  docs: |
    The type of remote machine that will be used to
    build this VM rather than a local desktop product. The only value accepted
    for this currently is esx5. If this is not set, a desktop product will
    be used. By default, this is not set.
- name: vm_name
  type: string
  docs: |
    This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual
    machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
    where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
